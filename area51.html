      <p>Area 51 is located in the southern portion of Nevada in the western of United States, 83 miles north-northwest
        of Las Vegas. This facility is officially called Homey Airport (KXTA) or Groom Lake, details of this facility's
        operations are secret, but the USAF says that it is an open training range and it most likely supports the
        development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. This base has never been declared a secret
        base, although all research and testing in Area 51 are Top Secret. The CIA publicly acknowledged the existence
        of the base for the first time on June 25 2013 following a Freedom of Information Act request filed in 2005, and
        they declassified documents detailing the history and purpose of Area 51</p>
      <p>In the summer of 1957, when the U-2 was deployed by the CIA and the test operations moved to Edwards Air Force
        Base, the base was essentially mothballed. The government admitted its existence all the way in 1955, when it
        was being built. The CIA used the Atomic Energy Commission as a front to put up this cover that they were making
        a small support facility for the Nevada Test Site, where the atomic weapons were tested. Eventually, they
        realized that people were going to see these planes flying around, so they came up with a story that the U-2 was
        a weather research airplane, supposedly being used by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the
        predecessor to NASA. They managed to uphold it a little by doing weather research during training flights, but
        it was really a spy plane. It’s the secrecy of Area 51 that makes it so fascinating and enthralling to the
        public just the fact of a secret base in the middle of the desert atract people, that secret nature of Area 51
        just breeds speculation. It’s a blank slate for any kind of conspiracy theory, and the Air Force hasn’t helped
        themselves because they’ve refused to talk about it. </p>

      <p>Bob Lazar is a physicist who claimed to have been hired as a physicist working at S-4, a site near the famous
        Area 51. He had earned degrees in physics from MIT and electronic technology from Caltech. Lazar claims that he
        was hired by the government to worked on a project where he analized captured alien technology.</p>
      <p>During the course of Lazar’s interviews, he’s discussed the various alien crafts he witnessed while working at
        S-4, supposedly originating from Zeta Reticuli, some 39 light years away. According to Lazar the crafts move by
        use of engines capable of manipulating gravity using an unknown element later known as Element 115. Element 115
        was used in reactors to create a field of gravity waves which allowed the crafts to counteract the Earth’s
        gravity or create an artificial downhill in any direction they chose.</p>
      <p>Lazar claims he examined an alien craft that ran on an antimatter reactor powered by element 115, which at the
        time had not yet been synthesized. He also claimed that he read briefing documents describing the historical
        involvement of Earth for the past 10,000 years with extraterrestrial beings described as grey aliens from a
        planet orbiting the twin binary star system Zeta Reticuli. The Zeta Reticuli system was previously claimed by
        Barney and Betty Hill as the origin of aliens they allegedly encountered. As of September 2019, no extrasolar
        planets have been found in the Zeta Reticuli system</p>

      <p>Matty Roberts was the creator of the event. He created the event on Facebook on June 27 2019 as a joke, unaware
        of the viral attention that it would receive.The event was planned to take place near the Area 51 location from
        3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on September 20 2019.
        The slogan of the Facebook event was "If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let’s see them
        aliens", referring to the running style of anime Naruto where the characters run with their arms stretched
        behind them, head down and torso tilted forward. Roberts stated the event had only received around 40 responses
        three days into the event's listing and suddenly and unexpectedly went viral.
        The Facebook page for the event was filled with thousands of satirical posts discussing topics like means of
        breaking into Area 51, the page virality caused Roberts to worry that he would receive a visit from the Federal
        Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I). The event received 2 million "going" and another 1.5 million "interested"
        signatures as of August 22.
      </p>
      <p>Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated officials were aware of the event and issued a warning saying:
        "Area 51 is an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come
        into the area where we train American armed forces", also said "The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to
        protect America and its assets, any attempt to illegally access the area is highly discouraged".
        The events also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to post two temporary flight restrictions,
        closing the airspace above two places nearby Area 51 during the days of the event.
      </p>
      <p>Nick Pope, who formerly investigated UFOs for Britain's Ministry of Defense, said on "Fox & Friends First:
        "If the U.S. government did find aliens, they didn't tell us Brits," referring to his work with the British
        government. He said if anything alien-related was ever at Area 51, it's "probably long gone" since the site has
        been so heavily connected to conspiracy theories.
        “I think this just shows the huge level of interest in this subject," said Pope explaining that visitors to Area
        51 would be more likely to find drones and "next-generation aircraft" than UFOs or evidence of aliens.
