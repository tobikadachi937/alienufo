      <p>Grey Aliens are perhaps the most recognized and popular of all alien species, consistently they appeared in
        television and films. The Roswell crash in 1947 was one of the most popular cases and helped to first brought
        these beings to the public eye, sparking an obsession with these creatures that still exists today. It is
        believed that The Greys have been operating on Earth for quite some time.</p>
      <p>The planetary origin of this species is believed to be Zeta Reticuli, in a wide binary star system in the
        southern constellation of Reticulum. Although there is the possibility that several species of Greys had their
        origin from different points in the galaxy such as the Orion system. There also exists the possibility that they
        are a later evolution of the human species, and that over use of cloning and genetic manipulation has destroyed
        their DNA and driven them nearly to the point of extinction. This hypothesis could help explain the harvesting
        of human tissues and prevalence of cattle mutilations as an attempt to refresh their own genetic makeup.</p>
      <p>The greatest concern about The Greys is their agenda and intentions for planet Earth and the humans that
        inhabit this world. It is widely agreed that they seem to be involved in a long-term experiment using the
        genetic makeup of our species, carefully following and abducting individuals, then subjecting them to many tests
        and attempting to wipe clean the memories of these frightening experiences. In many cases people claim that the
        Greys communicate through telepathy and often employ mind control when interacting with test subjects. It is
        said that they can stun and subdue people with their dark and fathomless eyes, implanting memories and rendering
        abductees immobile. The Greys are highly intelligent beings, but they value more science above spirituality to
        the point that Greys appear unconcerned with human emotions viewing us as simple test subjects.</p>

      <h2 id="indice2">Nordic Aliens</h2> <br><br>
      <p>Ancient civilizations around the world have spoken of extraordinary beings that descended from the sky sent by God to assist humanity by sharing their spiritual and emotional wisdom with Earthlings. These mythological entities appear to continue their mission to this day and many believe they are a extraterrestrial species known as the Nordic or Pleiadian race.</p>
      <p>The Nordics are a human-like species who first began appearing to contactees in the 1950s claiming to be from the Pleiades star cluster. Nordic aliens are also known as Tall Whites and Space Brothers, they are related with angelic beings represented in many religions and ancient civilizations.</p>
      <p>Many contactees have claimed to receive channeled message of peace and love from these beings, and much of the information available about the species is obtained in this manner. The Nordics are concerned with the spiritual evolution of humanity, and often remind contactees that we are closely related to them, only that humans are at a lesser development stage. The message that seems to follow each encounter with the Nordic species is the importance of spiritual awareness and the stewardship of our planet, the human ascension process involves learning how to overcome our differences in order to live as one, in harmony.</p>

      <h2 id="indice3">Reptilians</h2> <br><br>
      <p>Reptilians are undoubtedly an evil kind and intent enslaving humanity for their own selfish reasons. They are known to use their most infamous arm of clandestine influence, the Illuminati. </p>
      <p>Reptilian are famous for be shapeshifters(can transform) and a psychopathic ruling class that pulls the strings in all of the world’s financial and political power structures. But does this make sense? Well decisions made by politicians, bankers, and the global elite are often selfish, detrimental to the environment, and subversive to the betterment of society at large – three signs of psychopathy.</p>
      <p>There is also a hierarchy of which the full-bloods or Dracos, sit atop, maintaining control of the hybrids who are unaware they are even reptilian. The world’s most influential political figures are of the hybrid ilk, including modern presidents, prime ministers, and bankers. Others believe some hybrids exist sticks to institutions and political entities, especially those with nefarious histories like the CIA, Bilderberg Group, and the Trilateral Commission.</p>
